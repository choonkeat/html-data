# HtmlData

Yet another pure data representation of [elm/html](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/html/latest).

Perhaps some types need not be opaque after all.

## Out of scope

- parsing html https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/hecrj/html-parser/latest/
- turn an Elm app into a static HTML site https://github.com/eeue56/elm-static-html https://github.com/ThinkAlexandria/elm-static-html

some of these functionalities will be provided though `HtmlData.Extra` instead.
