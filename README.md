# HtmlData

Yet another pure data representation of [elm/html](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/html/latest). (Perhaps some types need not be opaque after all)

## Out of scope

- Parsing html https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/hecrj/html-parser/latest/
- Turn an Elm app into a static HTML site https://github.com/eeue56/elm-static-html https://github.com/ThinkAlexandria/elm-static-html

## Useful Functions

There's only types here. Actual _functionalities_ are provided through [`HtmlData.Extra`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/choonkeat/html-data-extra/latest/) instead so as to keep the dependencies of this package to a minimum.

See [https://html-data.netlify.app](https://html-data.netlify.app) for a demo of how we can use these data types; code in [github.com/choonkeat/explore-html-data-extra](https://github.com/choonkeat/explore-html-data-extra/blob/main/src/Main.elm)
